# Withings CLI

A simple way to query Withings API from command line.

### Set your API key and secret

[Register as a Withings developer](https://oauth.withings.com/partner/add)
and configure your Withings API key and secret.

```bash
withings config apikey [KEY]
withings config apisecret [SECRET]
```

*Note!* Do not disclose your API secret to anyone. As per the Withings'
Terms of Service, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy
and security of your keys.

*Note!* Keys will be stored in `~/.withings` (programmatically chmod to 0600).

### Add user

```bash
withings add me
```

*Note!* For withings-cli to be able to access user data, the user should allow
it to do so (*me* in this case). This call will automatically open a web browser
directed to Withings account login page.

### Check who am I

The following call should show mes details â€” if the above step was accomplished.

```bash
withings whois me
```

### Try query mes body measures

```bash
withings query -v1 -s measure -p action getmeas me
```

See how the query format corresponds to
[Withings API reference](https://oauth.withings.com/api/doc)

```
withings query -v[VERSION] -s SERVICE -p NAME VALUE -p NAME VALUE ... USER
```
